# Azure Synapse & Data Factory Workshop

## What is Azure Synapse?

Azure Synapse Analytics is a limitless analytics service that brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics. It gives you the freedom to query data on your terms, using either serverless or dedicated optionsâ€”at scale.

## What is Azure Data Factory?

Azure Data Factory is Azure's cloud ETL service for scale-out serverless data integration and data transformation. It offers a code-free UI for intuitive authoring and single-pane-of-glass monitoring and management. You can also lift and shift existing SSIS packages to Azure and run them with full compatibility in ADF. Thus, Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based PaaS Solution which combines capabilities such as data integration services, orchestration & automation, and data transformation.
